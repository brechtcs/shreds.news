# Shreds

Shreds is a better way to follow people on Twitter. Read your home timeline without it getting overwhelmed by a handful of high-frequency tweeters. You can sign in with [your Twitter account](https://shreds.news/login) to have a look!

## Upcoming

For now, Shreds only implements a view for the home timeline. All other features link back to the main Twitter web app. I don't have many firm opinions yet about which functionalities I want to include in Shreds, and which I can do without. If you want to chip in with your thoughts, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/brechtcs/shreds.news/issues).
